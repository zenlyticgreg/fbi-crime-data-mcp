# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

FBI Crime Data MCP Server — a Python MCP server providing 17 tools (15 for querying the FBI Crime Data Explorer API at `https://api.usa.gov/crime/fbi/cde`, plus 2 admin tools for cache and spillover management). Built with `fastmcp` (v3.2+) and `httpx`, deployable via `uvx fbi-crime-data-mcp`.

## Build & Run

```bash
uv sync                                           # install deps
FBI_API_KEY=xxx uv run fbi-crime-data-mcp          # run server (stdio)
uv run pytest                                      # run tests
FBI_API_KEY=xxx uv run pytest -m integration        # integration tests (hits real API)
```

## Architecture

- `src/fbi_crime_data_mcp/server.py` — FastMCP server entry point with lifespan context. Imports all tool modules. Configures three `ResponseCachingMiddleware` instances with `FileTreeStore` for tiered disk-backed caching (90-day TTL for summaries/trends/reference/NIBRS estimation; 30-day TTL for agency lookups and granular crime/officer data; 1-day TTL for homepage summary), plus a `ResponseSpilloverMiddleware` for oversized responses. Cache persists to `~/.cache/fbi-crime-data-mcp/`.
- `src/fbi_crime_data_mcp/api_client.py` — Shared `httpx.AsyncClient` wrapper with sliding-window rate limiter (1000 req/hr). `AppContext` dataclass is the lifespan context available to all tools via `ctx.lifespan_context`.
- `src/fbi_crime_data_mcp/response_utils.py` — Post-processing for API responses: `process_crime_response()` trims verbose sections (tooltips, participated_population) and aggregates monthly `mm-yyyy` data into yearly totals; `filter_agencies_by_name()` does case-insensitive substring filtering on agency lists.
- `src/fbi_crime_data_mcp/constants.py` — All validation enums: SRS offenses, NIBRS codes, arrest offenses, bias codes, LESDC chart types, states.
- `src/fbi_crime_data_mcp/spillover.py` — `ResponseSpilloverMiddleware` saves oversized tool responses (>128K chars) to disk under `~/.cache/fbi-crime-data-mcp/spillover/`, returning a preview with the file path. Content-addressed filenames avoid duplicates.
- `src/fbi_crime_data_mcp/validators.py` — Shared validation helpers used by tools: level, data_type, aggregate, state, ORI, date format (mm-yyyy / yyyy), year range, and offense code validators. Also provides `build_geo_path()` for constructing national/state/agency API paths and `effective_aggregate()` for aggregate passthrough logic.
- `src/fbi_crime_data_mcp/tools/` — One module per tool, each registers via `@mcp.tool()` decorator on the shared `mcp` instance imported from `server.py`.

## Key Patterns

- Tools return strings (JSON or error messages), never raise exceptions to the MCP client.
- Date format varies by endpoint: `mm-yyyy` (most crime data), `yyyy` (PE, trends), or `year=YYYY` param (LEOKA, LESDC, UoF).
- Most tools use a `level` param (national/state/agency) with conditional `state`/`ori` requirements.
- API key is read from the `FBI_API_KEY` env var and sent as the `API_KEY` query parameter on every request.
- Six monthly crime data tools (summarized, NIBRS, arrests, hate crime, homicide, property) default to `aggregate="yearly"` which sums actuals, averages rates, and takes last population value. Pass `aggregate="monthly"` for monthly granularity. For the five tools that accept a `data_type` param, aggregation only runs when `data_type="counts"` (gated by `effective_aggregate()`); `summarized` has no `data_type` because the SRS endpoint always returns counts and rates together, and per-key strategies (`sum`/`avg`/`last`) handle each appropriately.
- `lookup_agency` supports `name_filter` for case-insensitive substring search on agency names (by_state and by_district lookups).
